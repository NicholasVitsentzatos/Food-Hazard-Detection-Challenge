      Grocery Products Co., a Milton, Pa., establishment, is voluntarily
      recalling approximately 386,000 pounds of canned ravioli because it
      contains an undeclared allergen  soy protein  and is incorrectly
      labeled, the U.S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection
      Service announced today.
      Soy protein is a known allergen. Persons who have an allergy or severe
      sensitivity to soy protein run the risk of possible allergic reactions if
      they consume this product.
      The product being recalled is 15-ounce cans of ""Chef BOYARDEE 99%
      Fat Free CHEESE Ravioli in Tomato Sauce,"" which actually contain
      15-ounces of beef ravioli. The bottom of each can bears the establishment
      code ""794,"" followed by the case code ""J17101 RF.""
      The ravioli was produced on Oct. 17, 2001 and distributed to retail
      establishments nationwide. The product was also exported to Haiti,
      Guatemala and Bermuda.
      ""We urge consumers, especially those allergic or sensitive to soy,
      to check their cupboards and pantries,"" said Margaret OK. Glavin,
      acting FSIS administrator. ""If they find the product listed above,
      consumers should not eat it, but return it to the point of purchase.""
      ConAgra identified the labeling problem after customers notified the
      company of the mislabeling.
      Consumers with questions about the recall may contact ConAgras
      consumer hotline at (800) 414-2500. Media with questions may contact Kay
      Carpenter, Corporate Communications, at (949) 437-1144.

    FOOD ALLERGIES Consumers who have a food allergy or severe food sensitivity should always
    read ingredient labels. In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing
    ingredient is in the food. 
    A food allergy occurs when the immune
    system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed. 
    Symptoms may include throat swelling,
    trouble breathing, or a rash. 
    Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food
    is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. 
    Several foods account for 90% of allergic
    reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs,

33,2004,3,19,na,Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water,"Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water Friday 19 March 2004 Category D: For information only Ref: 12/2004 Heads of Environmental Health Services and Directors of Trading Standards will wish to be aware of a product withdrawal by The Coca-Cola Company of their Dasani brand bottled still water. The product has been found to contain raised levels of bromate, which exceed the permitted quantity stated in the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 as amended. The product has been on sale throughout the UK in retail outlets and from vending machines. The product recalled is: All Dasani bottled still water No other Coca Cola products are known to be affected Local authorities may wish to refer to the Food Standard Agency's web statement and Q&A regarding Dasani water attached below. The Coca-Cola Company has issued a press statement (see attached). In addition a consumer care line has been set up by the company, the number for which is: 0800 227 711. Product withdrawal statement issued by the Coca-Cola Company Voluntary withdrawal of Dasani in UK 11.45 am Friday 19 March To ensure that only products of the highest quality are provided to our consumers, Coca-Cola is voluntarily withdrawing all Dasani products currently in the marketplace in the UK. The withdrawal began on Friday, 19 March 2004, and will be 80-85 per cent completed within 24 hours. Calcium is a legal requirement in all bottled water products in the UK, including Dasani. To deliver the required calcium, we add back calcium chloride into the product. Through detailed analysis, we discovered that our product did not meet our quality standards. Because of the high level of bromide contained in the calcium chloride, a derivate of bromide, bromate, was formed at a level that exceeded UK legal standards. This occurred during the ozonisation process we employ in manufacturing. Immediately after we identified this issue, we consulted with the Food Standards Agency. The FSA has confirmed that there is no immediate health or safety issue. The withdrawal is a precautionary measure. If consumers have concerns or wish to return product purchased they should contact the free phone consumer care line 0800 227 711. The care line number appears on all Dasani packs.

 The product labels do not specifically state that egg white lysozyme, an allergen, is an ingredient.
                                  
 The following products are subject to recall: 
                                   24-ounce bags of BERTOLLI, MEATBALLS POMODORO & PENNE with peppers and onions in a tomato basil sauce, Complete Skillet Meal for Two. Each label includes the establishment number, EST. 21340 inside the USDA mark of inspection.

                                                                                               FOOD ALLERGIES
                                              
                                               
Consumers who have a food allergy, or severe food sensitivity, should always read ingredient labels. In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing ingredient is in the food.
                                              
A food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed.
                                              
Symptoms may include throat swelling, breathing trouble or a rash.
                                              
Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction.
                                              
Several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.
                                              
Persons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.
                                              
                                          
                                                                               
                                                                            
                                    
 The products were produced on various dates in September 2005, December 2005, January 2006 and February 2006 and sold to retail establishments nationwide.
                                  
 National Custom Packaging, Inc., a Castroville, Calif., establishment (Est. 21340) serves as the co-packer for Unilever United States, Inc.s Bertolli brand products and packaged these products subject to recall.
                                  
 The problem was discovered by a supplier who then notified the company. FSIS has had no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an allergic reaction should contact a physician.
                                  
 Consumers with questions about the recall should call the Bertolli toll-free recall hotline at (866) 837-7592.

63,2009,1,30,us,2009 - meijer announces voluntary recall for some meijer brand peanuts and ice cream novelties citing possible health risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- GRAND RAPIDS, MI – January 30, 2009, Meijer initiated a voluntary recall of two types of its Meijer Brand dry-roasted peanuts and four types of Meijer Brand ice cream novelties sold in all of its stores in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. Meijer removed all identified products from its stores and gas stations. All sell-by dates are impacted by this recall.
Specifically, Meijer has recalled the following items:
Meijer has taken these steps following announcements from the products' manufacturers that they may possibly be contaminated with salmonella. While none of the Meijer brand products have been identified as contaminated or linked to any illness, Meijer has received these products from Nut Bar Company, Inc. and Fieldbrook Foods, both of which used peanuts from Peanut Corporation of America in Blakely, Georgia, which has been verified as the source of contaminated peanut products.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
Meijer requests that customers who have purchased these products destroy the product or return them to any Meijer location for a full refund. If Meijer customers are unsure if they have the recalled product, they are requested to bring in the product for determination or contact the Meijer customer contact center at 800-543-3704. Consumers with questions or concerns about their health should contact their health care provider. If symptoms are present, please visit a health care provider or go to a hospital emergency room.
""The safety of our customers is always our number one priority,” said Frank J. Guglielmi, director of public relations for Meijer.

67,2009,5,17,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america announces voluntary nationwide recall of peanut butter,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (January 13, 2009) – Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies, today announced a voluntary recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely, Georgia processing facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
All product affected was produced on or after July 1, 2008, specific to the lot numbers and descriptions listed below.
The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food service industry use. It is also sold under the brand name Parnell’s Pride to those same industries. Additionally, it is sold by the King Nut Company under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing.
None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores.
“We deeply regret that this has happened,” said Stewart Parnell, owner and president of PCA. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority.”
PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA.
According to the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the already-opened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states.
The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number 1-877-564-7080 to answer questions.
PCA is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation.
According to a CDC update issued on their website today (January 13, 2009), preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. The CDC and other public health officials are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strains, and to gather and analyze data or exposures that may be associated with illness. To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.
Customers are asked to take all peanut butter manufactured with the lot numbers listed below out of distribution immediately. Customers can call the following toll-free 24-hour number 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company website at www.peanutcorp.com for additional information.
Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. Most people infected with Salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. For more information on the salmonella bacteria, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.

71,2010,1,15,us,New York Firm Recalls Beef Carcass That Contains Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, January 15, 2010 - Jerry Hayes Meats Inc., a Newark Valley, N.Y., establishment is recalling approximately 490 pounds of a beef carcass that may not have had the spinal column removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of spinal cord and vertebral column from cattle over 30 months of age, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 Spinal cord and vertebral column are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle over 30 months of age in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.
                                  
 The products subject to recall include: 
                                   1- ""BEEF CARCASS,"" which bears the establishment number ""EST. 04488 M"" inside the USDA mark of inspection.
                                  
 The product was packed on January 7, 2010, and sold to a single customer in New York.
                                  
 The problem was discovered through routine FSIS inspection activities. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

73,2010,8,6,us,California Firm Recalls Frozen Ground Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157: H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 6, 2010 - Valley Meat Company, a Modesto, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately one million pounds of frozen ground beef patties and bulk ground beef products that may be contaminated with  
                                  E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 FSIS became aware of the problem on July 15 when the agency was notified by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of a small  
                                  E. coli O157:H7 cluster of illnesses with a rare strain as determined by PFGE subtyping. A total of six patients with illness onset dates between April 8 and June 18, 2010 were reported at that time. After further review, CDPH added another patient from February to the case count, bringing the count to seven. FSIS is continuing to work with the CDPH and the company on the investigation. Anyone with signs or symptoms of foodborne illness should contact a health care provider.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160° F.
                                              
 Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as  
                                              E. coli O157:H7.
                                              
The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

 The products subject to recall bear the establishment number ""EST. 8268"" inside the USDA mark of inspection as well as a production code of 27509 through 01210. These products were produced on various dates between Oct. 2, 2009 and Jan. 12, 2010 and were distributed to retail outlets and institutional foodservice providers in California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Arizona and internationally, and to a firm in California for further processing. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at  
                                  http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/

 FSIS and the establishment are concerned that some product may still be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product that is the subject of this recall.
                                  E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of a recall and that steps are taken to make certain that a suspect product is no longer available to consumers.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
                                  
 Media and consumer questions regarding the recall should be directed to the company's spokespeople, Vanessa Smith at (916) 492-5314 or Brooke Burgess at (916) 492-5321.

74,2010,8,19,us,2010 - NuCal Foods Conducts Recall of Shell Eggs Supplied from Wright County Egg Because of Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Ripon, California - August 17, 2010 - The following statement was released by officials of NuCal Foods of Ripon, California regarding the voluntary recall of shell eggs supplied from Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa.
NuCal Foods is voluntarily recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis or arthritis.
Eggs affected by this recall were distributed to food wholesalers and retailers in California and Nevada. NuCal Foods received these eggs from Wright County Egg which were then packaged into 5-dozen overwrapped retail units. In addition to those products listed in the original Wright County Egg media statement dated August 13, 2010, the following products are being recalled:
 
Dates and codes can be found printed on the overwrap film. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number, for example P-1686 142.
Wright County Egg’s media statement indicates that there have been confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses relating to shell eggs from Wright County Egg, and traceback investigations are ongoing.
Consumers who believe they may have purchased these shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. This recall is of shell eggs only. Consumers with questions should call 1-877-249-8224 or visit www.eggsafety.org.

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
                                              
Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to

If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do  
                                              not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods.

 The problem was discovered through company lab testing which confirmed a positive result for  
                                  E.coli O157:H7. The company did not hold product pending test results, resulting in this recall.

 E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

89,2012,4,20,us,Michigan Firm Recalls Calzone Products for Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, April 20, 2012 - Albie's Foods, a Gaylord, Mich. establishment, is recalling approximately 311 pounds of pizza calzone products due to possible contamination with  
                                  Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 The fully cooked, ready-to-eat, calzone products were produced on April 10, 2012, and then shipped to institutions in Indiana and Michigan. The following products are subject to recall: [View

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
                                              
Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to

handwashing
                                              . If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses. Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160° F, as measured with a food thermometer, before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for ground meat such as beef and pork is 160° F, and 165° F for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

 FSIS became aware of the problem during the course of an  
                                  ongoing investigation of a multi-state outbreak of  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis involving 33 case-patients from 7 states (MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VA, VT-preliminary data, subject to change). Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vermont Department of Health, New York State Department of Health, and New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, FSIS was able to link illnesses in five case-patients to the ground beef products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews. Illness onset dates among these five case-patients ranged from June 6, 2012 to June 13, 2012. Two of the five case-patients were hospitalized. Leftover product with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the Vermont Department of Health tested positive for  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis with the outbreak strain. This outbreak strain of  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis is drug sensitive, meaning antibiotics can be effective in treating patients who need them. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC and public health partners on the investigation.
                                  
 Consumption of food contaminated with  
                                  Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses.  
                                  Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

100,2012,10,10,us,"2012 - Dean Foods Company of California and Meadow Gold Dairy Conduct Voluntary Recall of Two Albertsons Brand Ice Cream Varieties - Peanut Butter Cup and Peanut Butter Chocolate in 1.5 Quarts Sizes - Due to Potential Health Risk Posed by Nationwide Sunland, Inc. Peanut Butter","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – October 10, 2012 – The Dean Foods Company of California processing facility in Buena Park, Calif., and Meadow Gold Dairy processing facility in Orem, Utah, are taking the precautionary measure to voluntarily recall two ice cream varieties manufactured for Albertsons supermarkets. This recall was initiated because the affected products contain a peanut butter ingredient supplied by Sunland, Inc. which may be contaminated with Salmonella. The peanut butter manufacturer Sunland recently expanded its nationwide product recall.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
To date, no complaints or reactions have been reported related to these ice cream products, and only two flavors of Albertsons ice cream are included in the recall. No Meadow Gold® brand ice cream products are included in this recall. Both the “Peanut Butter Cup” and “Peanut Butter Chocolate” flavors are sold in 1.5 quarts (1.42L) cardboard cartons in Albertsons stores. Only the ice cream made in two plants is impacted by this recall and therefore the product being recalled was sold between 3/26/2010 and 9/25/2012 only in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.
The ice cream is printed with one of two plant codes: either 49-11 or 06-20 and a “BEST BY” or “EXP” date ranging from 3/26/2011 to 9/25/2013.
No other Albertsons or Meadow Gold brand ice cream products are affected by this recall. In particular, this recall only impacts Albertsons ice cream products with the plant codes of 49-11 or 06-20 and sold in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.
The processing facilities have ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product package to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the Company at 1-800-587-2259 between 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of this voluntary recall.

104,2012,10,22,us,Recall Notification Report 067-2012,"WASHINGTON, Oct 22, 2012 - BEF Foods Inc., a Columbus, Ohio, corporation, is recalling approximately 1,768,600 pounds of Bob Evans Maple Links and Maple Patties because they are misbranded in that they contain monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is not declared on the label. The products were produced at establishments in Hillsdale, MI and Xenia, OH.
The products subject to recall include:12-oz. packages of Bob Evans Maple Links with UPC numbers of 075900002300, 075900000085 and 075900002324.

12-oz. packages of Bob Evans Maple Patties with UPC numbers of 075900002508 and 075900000795 and 075900002522.

The products were produced between April 4, and Oct. 19, 2012, and will have the establishment number M-952 or M-6785 inkjetted on the side of the package. Product purchased fresh will have a use-by date between Oct. 14, 2012 and Dec. 4, 2012 listed. Instead of a use-by date, frozen products may be identified by any of the following Julian codes: 0264 through 0365, 1001 through 1365, and 2001 through 2293.
The problem was discovered by the company during a label audit. When the company reformulated their products, they discontinued the use of a spice blend containing MSG and removed MSG from the ingredient list on the label. During the label audit, the company discovered that the individual establishments were still using a spice blend containing MSG. MSG is not classified as an allergen, but can cause a reaction in people with a sensitivity to MSG.
FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks (including at restaurants) to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.
Media with questions about the recall should contact the companys Director of Corporate Communications, Margaret Standing, at (614) 492-4921.

Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary breakdown in the company's production and packaging processes. The FDA is aware of this recall by Turkana Food Inc. Turkana Food Inc. will take the necessary measures to recall the products. Already steps have been taken to quarantine the product in our warehouse. In addition, we will contact customers to inform them that they need to pull this recalled product “Turkana Valley” dried apricots 250g (8.82oz) and 500g (17.63oz), off their shelves and keep them in their storage room until we collect them.

110,2013,2,11,us,2013 - Nestlé Prepared Foods Company Announces Voluntary Recall of LEAN CUISINE® Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - February 8, 2013 - Nestlé Prepared Foods Company today announced the voluntary recall of two production codes of LEAN CUISINE® Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358. The production codes are 2311587812 and 2312587812; the “best before date” appears as DEC 2013.
The voluntary recall is limited to these two days of production, which were distributed nationwide. No other production dates, sizes or varieties of LEAN CUISINE products are affected by this recall. The reason for the recall is that the meal may contain fragments of glass. Nestlé is taking this action after three consumers reported they had found small fragments of glass in the ravioli portion of the entrée. No injuries were reported by any of the consumers.
The entrée being recalled was produced during early November, 2012. Due to its popularity, Nestlé believes very little remains in retail distribution. For this reason, Nestlé is reaching out to consumers to ask that they examine their freezer inventory for specific packages of LEAN CUISINE®, Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358 with production codes 2311587812 and 2312587812 and a “best before date” which appears as DEC 2013. To locate the production code, consumers should look for the gray “proof of purchase” panel, located on the right end flap of the package, below the ingredient statement.
Consumers who may have purchased the recalled LEAN CUISINE item should not consume the product, but instead should contact Nestlé Consumer Services at (866) 586-9424 or leancuisine@casupport.com for further instructions. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., ET and this Saturday, February 9, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Nestlé will provide a replacement coupon to reporting consumers and also may make arrangements to retrieve the product for further examination.
Nestlé is dedicated to food quality, and the health and safety of its consumers. For these reasons, the company initiated this recall. We apologize to our retail customers and consumers and sincerely regret any inconvenience created by this voluntary product recall.

119,2013,7,13,us,2009 - torres hillsdale country cheese llc expands the recall of asadero and oaxaca cheeses due to possible listeria contamination,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- March 23, 2009 -- Torres Hillsdale Country Cheese of Reading, Michigan is expanding the recall of Asadero and Oaxaca soft Mexican-style cheeses due to potential Listeria contamination.   
Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause Listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths. The very young, the pregnant, the elderly and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to infection. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.
Products were distributed to the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Alabama.
A routine sample of Asadero cheese, taken by an inspector from the Michigan Department of Agriculture’s Food and Dairy Division on February 23, 2009, was subsequently tested by the Michigan Department of Agriculture Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
The recalled Asadero and Oaxaca cheese products were distributed to retails stores and delis in 10 lb balls, 16- and 12 oz plastic packages, sold under the name ""Aguas Calientes"". Product was also sold in 6 lb blocks shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, under the name ""El Jaliciense"". Packaging may also include a label with the name ""Torres Hillsdale Country Cheese LLC"".
The recall encompasses all productions dates between August 1, 2008 (expiration date 10/29/2008) and February 27, 2009 (expiration date 5/10/2009).

120,2013,7,16,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america provides additional information about expanded nationwide recall of peanut products,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (February 8, 2009) -- In connection with the January 28, 2009 expanded recall announcement issued by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), the company wishes to highlight important information regarding several of its products.
On January 28, 2009, PCA announced it was voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely, Georgia facility since January 1, 2007 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurisms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
PCA has not manufactured any products in cans and jars since 2007. However, because the January 28th recall notice indicated that PCA does not sell products directly to consumers in stores, and because the expanded recall includes PCA products made since the beginning of 2007, the potential for confusion may exist. Therefore, the company is highlighting information about those former retail offerings to assist consumers who may have purchased those products and who may still have them in their possession. These products were part of the January 28th recall, but here, they are individually listed. Consumers should be aware that the list below includes only PCA's own brands that were sold to consumers at retail. The list does not include brands made by PCA for other firms. FDA continues to update its website to alert the public about any new recalls.
PCA sold its Casey’s, Parnell’s Pride, Reggie, and Robinson Crusoe labels to 99 Cent Stuff, 99 Cents Only Stores, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree Stores. Below is a list of items and UPC codes that were shipped to these discount retail chain stores and other customers that are affected by this recall:

131,2013,10,12,us,California Wholesale Store Recalls Rotisserie Chicken Products Due to Possible Salmonella Heidelberg Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12, 2013 – Costco’s El Camino Real store in South San Francisco, Calif., is recalling 9,043 units (approximately 39,755 lbs.) of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with a strain of Salmonella Heidelberg, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The products subject to recall are:

8,730 “Kirkland Signature Foster Farms” rotisserie chickens

313 total units of “Kirkland Farm” rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad
The products were sold directly to consumers in a Costco located at 1600 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, Calif., between Sept. 11 and Sep. 23, 2013.

This recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the Costco El Camino Real store. The PFGE pattern (0258) associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the United States. FSIS, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. For more information about the larger cluster, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact Costco at (800) 774-2678.

FSIS reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces.

FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 °F internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 °F must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer.

All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° F as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day.

Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis:

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing.

If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160º F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.",washington oct 12 2013 costcos el camino real store south san francisco calif recalling 9043 units approximately 39755 lbs rotisserie chicken products contaminated strain salmonella heidelberg department agricultures food safety inspection service fsis announced today products subject recall 8730 kirkland signature foster farms rotisserie chickens 313 total units kirkland farm rotisserie chicken soup rotisserie chicken leg quarters rotisserie chicken salad products sold directly consumers costco located 1600 el camino real south san francisco calif sept 11 sep 23 2013 recall initiated concerns group salmonella heidelberg illnesses associated consumption rotisserie chicken products prepared purchased costco el camino real store pfge pattern 0258 associated outbreak reported rarely united states fsis working centers disease control prevention cdc california department public health county san mateo public health department determined epidemiologic traceback investigations link costco el camino real rotisserie chicken products illness outbreak fsis continuing work cdc public health partners california costco investigation fsis continue provide information available group illnesses larger cluster salmonella heidelberg illnesses known multidrug resistant information larger cluster visit httpwwwcdcgovsalmonellaheidelberg1013indexhtml fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks verify recalling firms notify customers recall steps taken make certain product longer available consumers costco taken steps contact customer purchased rotisserie chicken products available retail distribution lists posted fsis website httpwwwfsisusdagovwpsportalfsistopicsrecallsandpublichealthalertscurrentrecallsandalerts consumers media questions regarding recall contact costco 800 7742678 fsis reminds consumers properly handle raw poultry manner prevent contamination spreading foods food contact surfaces fsis reminds consumers critical importance following package cooking instructions frozen fresh chicken products general food safety guidelines handling preparing raw meat poultry particular cooking instructions specific number minutes cooking product order attain 165 f internal temperature consumers aware actual time vary depending cooking method broiling frying grilling temperature product chilled versus frozen important final temperature 165 f reached safety rely cooking time product use food thermometer poultry products cooked safe minimum internal temperature 165 f determined food thermometer using food thermometer way know food reached high temperature destroy foodborne bacteria consumption food contaminated salmonella cause salmonellosis common bacterial foodborne illnesses salmonella infections lifethreatening especially weak immune systems infants elderly persons hiv undergoing chemotherapy common symptoms salmonellosis diarrhea abdominal cramps fever 72 hours additional symptoms chills headache nausea vomiting seven days consumers food safety questions ask karen fsis virtual representative available 24 hours day askkarengov tollfree usda meat poultry hotline 1888mphotline 18886746854 available english spanish reached 10 4 pm eastern time monday friday recorded food safety messages available 24 hours day recommendations preventing salmonellosis wash hands handling raw meat poultry warmhot preferred cold soapy running water rubbing hands vigorously 20 seconds wash cutting boards dishes utensils hot preferred soapy water clean spills right away mechanical action vigorous rubbing hands utensilssurfaces creates friction helps dislodge bacteria viruses hands surfaces additionally warmhot water helps dissolve fatsfoods aiding cleaningmicrobe removal assist deactivation pathogens information hand washing httpwwwcdcgovhandwashing soapy water available use alcoholbased hand sanitizer contains 60 alcohol alcoholbased hand sanitizers reduce number germs hands situations sanitizers eliminate types germs including viruses raw meat fish poultry away food thoroughly cooked use separate cutting boards raw meat poultry juices thoroughly cooked foods thoroughly cook raw meat poultry safe internal temperatures 160º f ground meat beef pork 165º f poultry measured food thermometer eating refrigerate raw meat poultry hours purchase hour temperatures exceed 90º f refrigerate cooked meat poultry hours cooking,salmonella,california wholesale store recalls rotisserie chicken products possible salmonella heidelberg contamination,chicken

Foodservice Inc., a San Jose, Calif., establishment, is recalling 740 pounds of sausage products that may be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a physician.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

133,2014,3,7,us,Arkansas Firm Recalls Chicken Products Due To Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, March 7, 2014 – George’s Inc., a Springdale, Ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 29,200 pounds of seasoned raw, chicken breast strips due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products are formulated with soy protein, a known allergen, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). However, the product was released with a label for George’s boneless skinless breast pieces with rib meat, which does not declare soy or MSG on the label.

The products subject to recall bear the label:

40 lb. bulk cartons of “GEORGE’S BONELESS SKINLESS BREAST PIECES W/RIB MEAT” with case code 4790.
The products were produced and packaged from Dec. 21 through Dec. 23, 2013, and were sold to distributors in Tennessee and Iowa for further distribution. The recalled products bear the establishment number “P-13584” below the USDA Mark of Inspection and “Packed on” date in the format of “mm/dd/yy” on the carton label.

The problem was discovered after the company received a customer complaint of incorrectly labeled product. The customer noticed that the product they received appeared to be seasoned, when it was labeled as being simply boneless, skinless breast pieces. The company’s investigation found that the mislabeling occurred when the George’s label was mistakenly applied to allergen containing products packaged nearby. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Consumers with questions about the recall should contact Ali Perry at (479) 927-7256. Media with questions about the recall should contact Glen Balch at (479) 927-7105 or Dirk Lemmons at (479) 927-7106.

138,2014,5,29,us,Recall Notification Report 033-2014 (Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts),"WASHINGTON, May 29, 2014– Boulder Natural Meats, a Denver, Colo., establishment, is recalling approximately 363 pounds of Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts due to misbranding, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The product was formulated with wheat, which is declared on the product label, so all allergens are properly identified. However, the front label states the product is gluten free. Products with a gluten free claim may not contain wheat.

The following product is subject to recall:

1 to 1.5-lbs. vacuum sealed packages of “Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts brushed with Teriyaki Seasoning”
The product was produced May 13 and 14, 2014, and has a freeze by date of 05.24.14 or 05.25.14. The product bears the establishment number “P18852” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was sold to retail establishments in Colorado.

The problem was discovered by a retailer, which notified the company. After an investigation, it was determined that the front label was mislabeled “gluten free,” because an older label was mistakenly used.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of the product. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Consumers and media with questions about the recall should contact Heather Crane at (303) 301-5293.

142,2014,8,27,us,New Jersey Firm Recalls Breaded Chicken Product For Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 27, 2014 – TNUVA USA, a Fairfield, N.J., establishment is recalling approximately 8,316 pounds of Mom’s Chicken Extra Thin Cutlets product due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The product was produced on August 18, 2013, and shipped to the company’s distributor in New Jersey. FSIS will post complete store locations as the list becomes available on its website at www.fsis.usda.gov. The following product is subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

28.8-oz. (1.8 lb.) bags containing “MOM’S CHICKEN EXTRA THIN CUTLETS, THIN-CUT BREADED CUTLET SHAPED CHICKEN BREAST PATTIES.”
Bags bear the Israeli establishment number “209” within the Israeli mark of inspection. The product’s expiration date is February 18, 2015, and bears the following UPC number on the packaging: 843426005866.

The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel conducted a routine sampling of product which tested positive for Lm. FSIS held the product and it did not enter commerce. Further investigation by FSIS determined that other products were produced on the same line without clean up between products. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

144,2014,9,6,us,"Maryland Firm Recalls Fresh, Raw Chicken Products Due To Possible Processing Flaw","WASHINGTON, Sept. 6, 2014 – Perdue Food LLC, a Salisbury, MD establishment, is recalling approximately 720 pounds of raw, fresh chicken products because they may have experienced a processing deviation in temperature during production, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The products being recalled were produced on the same day and equipment as the positive product. Products were shipped to distributors for sales nationwide.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 ° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should call Jeremy Turnquist, Vice President of Operations for Ranchers Legacy Meat Co. at (651) 366-6575.

161,2015,3,7,us,rio tex wholesale meats recalls ready-to-eat beef products due to possible listeria contamination,"WASHINGTON, March 6, 2015 – Rio Tex Wholesale Meats, a Mercedes, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 58,180 pounds of ready-to-eat beef products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The beef products were produced on various dates between March 25, 2014 and February 19, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods COOKED BEEF TACO FILLING.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods SEASONED COOKED BEEF BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods FULLY COOKED BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods BEEF CARNE GUISADA.”

15-lb. and 45-lb. boxes containing three 5-lb. or 15-lb. packages of “Rio-Tex-Meats BARBACOA.”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 13545” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped for hotels, restaurants and institutional use in Texas.

The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple Listeria monocytogenes positives. The historical sampling showed a recurrence of Lm isolates with indistinguishable Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns over a period of time within the establishment. The presence of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns in environmental samples (including food contact and non-food contact surfaces) and on ready-to-eat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with Lm.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Barney Trevino, Plant Manager, at (956) 565-1142.

164,2015,4,1,us,Robber’s Roost Jerky Recalls Beef and Pork Jerky Product Due to Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, April 1, 2015 –Robber’s Roost Jerky, an Ellensburg, Wash., establishment, is recalling approximately 4 pounds of ready-to-eat smoked beef and pork pepper stick jerky product that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The fully cooked beef and pork pepper stick jerky product was produced on March 24, 2015. The following product is subject to recall:

6” individual Cryovac sticks of “Smoked Beef & Pork Pepper Stick” with package code 032420150004. 
The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “EST. 19962M” inside the USDA mark of inspection. This product was shipped to local retail outlets in Washington.

The problem was discovered by the company after a sample from the cutting board used in preparation of the product returned a positive test result for Listeria monocytogenes. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness due to consumption of this product.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Mitch Truax, Operations Manager, at (509) 933-2211.

172,2015,8,13,us,Kapowsin Meats Recalls Pork Product Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 13, 2015 – Kapowsin Meats, a Graham, Wash. establishment, is recalling approximately 116,262 pounds of whole hogs that may be contaminated with Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-,the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The whole hogs for barbeque item were produced on various dates between April 18, 2015 and July 27, 2015. The following products are subject to recall:

Varying weights of Whole Hogs for Barbeque
The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “Est. 1628” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in Alaska and Washington.

On July 15, 2015, the Washington State Department of Health notified FSIS of an investigation of Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-illnesses. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and these illnesses. Traceback investigation has identified 32 case-patients who consumed whole hogs for barbeque from this establishment prior to illness onset. These illnesses are part of a larger illness investigation. Based on epidemiological evidence, 134 case-patients have been identified in Washington with illness onset dates ranging from April 25, 2015 to July 29, 2015. FSIS continues to work with our public health partners on this ongoing investigation.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145° F with a three minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in several places. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact John Anderson, Owner, at (253) 847-1777.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov.The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.

Wash hands with soap water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also, wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Clean spills immediately.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use one cutting board for raw meat, poultry and egg products and a separate one for fresh produce and cooked foods.

Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria.

The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

Beef, Pork, Lamb, &Veal (steaks, roasts, chops): 145°F with a three minute rest time

Ground meat: 160°F

189,2016,2,17,us,lipari foods issues voluntary recall of various retail and food service raw pistachio products due to potential salmonella risk,"Lipari Foods, LLC, of Warren, Michigan, has issued a voluntary recall of various raw pistachio products packaged by sister company JLM due to potential Salmonella risk. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella can experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The products were distributed to food service and retail stores throughout Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and West Virginia.
Products were distributed under the following brand names: Blue Goose Market, Hollywood Market, Market Fresh Fine Foods, Roger's Foodland, Marv & Alison's Marketplace, Long Lake Market, Martin's, Holiday Market, The Purple Onion, Trentwood Farms, Angeli Foods, Market Square, Village Food Market, Martha's Vineyard, Remke Market or as generic product without branding.
The affected products can be identified by:
There are no reported illnesses in connection with these products to date.
This was brought to our attention by our supplier, International Foodsource, LLC who recalled raw pistachios after testing performed by an FDA contract testing laboratory revealed the presence of Salmonella. As a precaution, Lipari Foods products are being recalled as they have the potential to be contaminated due to the fact that they were packed from an affected lot that was received from International Foodsource, LLC. We are working closely with International Foodsource, LLC and the FDA to understand the cause of the situation and ensure that all affected product has been pulled from commerce.
Consumers who have purchased this recalled product should not consume it. They should return it to the point of purchase.
Consumers with questions should call Customer Service at 1-800-729-3354, 8:15 am – 4:30 pm, EST, Monday through Friday.

205,2016,5,9,us,"Let's Talk Health, Inc. Issues Alert on Undeclared Milk and Soy in Energizer Drink Mix","Let's Talk Health, Inc., is recalling its 15 packet jars of ""Energizer Drink Mix,"" Agua Vitae Liquid Multi-Vitamin, Agua Vitae Kids Liquid Multi-Vitamin and Tox-Elim because they contain an undeclared milk and soy allergen from Whey Protein. People who have allergies to soy and milk run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.
Recalled Products
The recalled ""Energizer Drink Mix,"" was Agua Vitae Liquid Multi-Vitamin, Agua Vitae Kids Multi-Vitamin and Tox-Elim distributed nationwide in retail stores and through mail orders.
The ""Energizer Drink Mix"" comes in 0.3 ounce, plastic packet marked with lot #14592 and #15411 for the strawberry/banana batches, lot #14593 and #15431 for the citrus batches and lot #14594 and 15432 for the pomegranate batches. The lot number can be found embossed on the top seal of the packet.
The Agua Vitae Liquid Multi-Vitamin comes in a 32 oz. white bottle and marked with lot numbers on the bottom of the bottle that include: 15258, 15483 and 15554.
The Agua Vitae Kids Liquid Multi-Vitamin comes in a 16 oz white bottle and marked with the lot number on the bottom: 15193
The Tox-Elim comes in a 32 oz. white bottle and marked with the lot number on the bottom: 15425.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the milk and soy allergen from Whey Protein was utilized by the manufacturer instead of a soy/milk free protein and therefore did not reveal the presence of the soy/milk allergen. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary breakdown in the company's production and packaging processes.
Production of the product has been suspended until the company is certain that the problem has been corrected.
Consumers who have purchased these products are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-888-950-2190 Monday - Friday between the hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm PST.

208,2016,6,8,us,Giant Eagle Expands Recall of Sunflower Seeds Sold At Market District Stores,"COLUMBUS – Giant Eagle supplier SunOpta has notified the retailer of a second expansion of the previously reported product recall on its sunflower seeds sold in the bulk section of three central Ohio Market District stores due to possible Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria) contamination.
The affected product was sold in the bulk foods sections of the Kingdale, Dublin and Grandview Yard Market District locations with a PLU of 65167. The additional recalled product was available for purchase at these locations both loose within the bulk bin through June 1, 2016, and in pre-packaged containers with sell by dates through December 1, 2016.

211,2016,6,13,us,Kellogg Company Voluntarily Recalls Certain Snacks for Potential Undeclared Peanut Residue Due to Flour Supplier Recall,"BATTLE CREEK, Mich. – Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today announced that it is voluntarily recalling certain varieties and limited dates of production of Mother's®, Keebler®, Kellogg's® Special K® brownies, Murray® and Famous Amos® snacks and cookies because they may contain undeclared peanut residue.

The ready-to-eat, Lifestyle Foods Inc. brand of Lemongrass Basil Chicken product was produced on June 13 and June 14, 2016. The following product is subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

8.0-oz. (227g) individually wrapped entrée packages labeled “Lifestyle Foods Lemongrass Basil Chicken Entrée – Brown Rice in a Thai Style Sauce with Grilled Chicken and Green Beans.” The product has “Enjoy By” dates of June 28, 2016 and June 29, 2016.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-9815” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington D.C.

The problem was discovered when Winter Gardens Quality Foods, Inc. notified FSIS that a component of the product had tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

The frozen, heat treated, not ready-to-eat (NRTE) chicken tenderloin items were produced on Jan. 25, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

30-lb. net-weight case containing six, 5-lb. bags in clear film of “Simmons UNCOOKED CHICKEN TENDERLOIN FRITTERS,” with a case code 31473, packaging date code of 6025, and a Use-By date of 01/25/17.
	30-lb. net-weight case containing six, 5-lb. bags in clear film of “Simmons UNCOOKED CHICKEN BREAST TENDERLOIN FRITTERS,” with a case code 62331 and a packaging date of 6025.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-5837” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were distributed to Arkansas for institutional use.

The problem was discovered on July 7, 2016, when Simmons Prepared Foods, Inc. received notice from a supplier that flour sold to the establishment was recalled by General Mills. The firm used the recalled flour to bread the chicken fritters affected by this recall action. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to consumption of these Simmons Prepared Foods, Inc. products.

Information on the General Mills’ recall can be found at:http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm509693.htm.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O121 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O121 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O121 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

			- Beef, pork, lamb chops/steaks/roasts: 145°F with a three minute rest time
			- Ground meat: 160°F
			- Poultry: 165°F

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. P-81A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

Bar-S Foods notified FSIS’ Dallas District Office on July 19, 2016, of its intention to recall five chicken and pork hot dog and corn dog products that could potentially be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The firm has not received test results for Listeria monocytogenes in connection with the recalled products, but due to recurring Listeria species issues at the firm, it has decided to remove the products from commerce as a precautionary measure. There have been no confirmed reports of illnesses or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Members of the media with questions regarding the recall can contact Manuel Rivera, Bar-S Foods’ Vice President of Marketing, at 1-888-241-6102. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can call the Bar-S Foods Consumer Hotline at 1-888-965-6134.

Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
There have been no reported illnesses to date.
This voluntary recall is the result of testing by a FDA-contracted laboratory which revealed that a 4oz package of Diamond of California® Chopped Macadamia Nuts contained Salmonella.
This voluntary recall covers only the following products:
The voluntary recall is limited to multiple production codes of the two products listed below. To locate the production code on the package, consumers should look on the front of the package. No other production codes, sizes or varieties of Diamond of California® products are affected by this recall.
Consumers who may have purchased the product listed above should not consume it but should contact Consumer Affairs for a full refund online at http://diamondfoods.com/contact/ or by calling 503-364-0399 between 8am and 5pm Pacific Time, Monday – Friday.

The fully cooked Panko Chicken Nuggets items were produced on July 18, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

5-lb. bag containing “Tyson FULLY COOKED PANKO CHICKEN NUGGETS” with a “Best If Used By” date of July 18, 2017 and case code 2006SDL03 and 2006SDL33.

20-lb. bulk packages containing “SPARE TIME Fully Cooked, Panko Chicken Nuggets, Nugget Shaped Chicken Breast Pattie Fritters With Rib Meat” with a production date of July 18, 2016 and case code 2006SDL03.

236,2016,11,19,us,Sabra Dipping Company Issues Voluntary Recall Of Certain Hummus Products Because Of Possible Health Risks,"Updated on November 23, 2016 with new information identified by asterick(*).
Colonial Heights, VA - Sabra Dipping Co., LLC is voluntarily recalling certain hummus products made prior to November 8, 2016 due to concerns over Listeria monocytogenes, which was identified at the manufacturing facility but not in tested finished product. The recall includes the products listed below; these were distributed to retail outlets, including food service accounts and supermarkets, in the U.S. and Canada.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.  The company is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution.
Consumers with any product with a “Best Before” date up through January 23, 2017 are urged to discard it. Consumers can find code and “Best Before” date on the lid of each package.
* The Sabra Party Platter Selects contains sealed and capped containers of Sabra Classic Hummus 7oz; cheese and Genoa Salame sliced at Daniele International, Inc; and pre-packaged breadsticks. The Genoa Salame is a USDA regulated product; the Party Tray includes the USDA mark of inspection next to the salami packaged in the tray and “EST. 9992” next to the pre-packaged breadsticks in the tray. These Party Trays are subject to recall; the entire contents of the Party Tray should not be consumed due to the potential for cross contamination of other tray components with the recalled hummus through consumer handling.
No other Sabra products are affected. In particular, Sabra products not included in the recall are: Sabra Organic Hummus, Sabra Salsa, Sabra Guacamole and Sabra Greek Yogurt Dips.
Consumers can contact Sabra Consumer Relations at 1-866-265-6761 for additional information from 9:00 am to 8:00 PM eastern time. For product reimbursement, consumers can contact www.sabrahummusrecall.com. Full list of impacted product is below. The company has subsequently taken steps to correct this matter.
The recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The voluntary recall, in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) includes selected products produced between October 20, 2016 and December 9, 2016 and shipped by Palmer Candy Company to grocery, convenience store and wholesale customers nationwide.

In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The recall is the result of a potentially contaminated milk powder ingredient recalled by Valley Milk Products, a derivative of which was included as a small portion of the ingredients by another company in a confectionary coating supplied to Palmer Candy Company. Affected products include a variety of candy products sold to retailers under the Palmer Candy Company brand, private label chocolates for retail distribution and bulk products provided to retailers for repackaging. Although testing has shown no pathogenic bacteria in the milk confectionary coatings, the company decided out of an abundance of caution to recall all products produced using any amount of the now recalled ingredients.

We remain committed to the highest standards in food quality and safety.

246,2017,1,23,us,"Specialty Commodities, Inc Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Cashew Allergen in Dry Roasted Almonds","Specialty Commodities, Inc. (SCI), a subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM), is recalling a specific lot of dry roasted almonds because they may contain undeclared cashews. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to cashews run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the cashew-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of cashews. 
The recalled dry roasted almonds were distributed between December 22, 2016, and January 19, 2017, to three customers, one of whom redistributed them for sale in either bulk bins or clam shells to retail outlets in California, including Safeway and Nugget Markets. Representatives of SCI are working with DSD Merchandisers Inc., the distribution customer, and these outlets to ensure the product is removed from shelves and returned. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this issue. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary process irregularity that occurred at the third-party contract manufacturer that processed and packaged the almonds for SCI. Then, an inventory processing irregularity resulted in the almonds being forwarded to the impacted customers. Please direct any customer inquiries to 770-752-8229 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday.

According to the information provided by the New Zealand authorities, the above-mentioned seven kinds of affected products have been imported to Hong Kong by an importer, Lee Fish Asia Limited. - Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in the newborns. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up with the importer concerned.

Recalls Frozen Pizza Product Due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, March 15, 2017 – RBR Meat Company, Inc., a Vernon, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 21,220 pounds of frozen pizza product that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The supreme frozen pizza item was produced on Feb. 23, 2017. The following product is subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

50.6-oz. corrugated box containing 1 shrink wrapped 16” pizza labeled as “Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza,” with lot code 20547. 
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 1821” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington.

The problem was discovered during routine sampling by the firm. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased this product are urged not to consume it. This product should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

262,2017,4,25,us,"Fineberg Packing Co., Inc. Recalls Ready-To-Eat Ham Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, April 25, 2017 – Fineberg Packing Co., Inc., a Memphis, Tenn. establishment, is recalling approximately 8,822 pounds of ready-to-eat ham products that may be adulterated withListeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat hickory smoked and BBQ ham items were packaged on January 16, 2017. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels (PDF Only)]

14-lb. vacuum-sealed packages containing “FINEBERG’S Finest Danish Brand BBQ Flavored Ham” with Sell by date 03/26/2017 and case code 17016.

30.6-lb. boxes containing 2 vacuum-sealed packages of “Holly Brand hickory smoked fully cooked HAM” with case code 17016.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 428” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee.

The problem was discovered during a Food Safety Assessment conducted by an FSIS employee. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

264,2017,4,28,us,Baraka Bakery and Grocery Recalls Ground Beef Products Due to Possible E. coli O157:H7 Adulteration,"WASHINGTON, April 27, 2017 – Baraka Bakery and Grocery, a Nashville, Tenn. retail firm, is recalling an undetermined amount of ground beef products that may be adulterated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The Halal ground beef items were processed and packaged on various dates from April 19, 2017 through April 26, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

Packages containing butcher ground to order “HALAL GROUND BEEF.”
These items were sold to consumers at the firm’s retail location in Tennessee.

The problem was discovered through routine FSIS retail sampling. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Nasser Yousef, Owner, at (615) 525-7111.

265,2017,5,5,us,"marcho farms, inc. recalls veal, beef and pork products due to possible non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec) adulteration","WASHINGTON, May 4, 2017 – Marcho Farms, Inc., a Souderton, Pa. establishment, is recalling approximately 5,620 pounds of boneless veal, and ground veal, beef and pork products that may be adulterated withnon-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O111, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The veal, beef and pork products were produced on April 11 and April 14, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

60-lb.cases of “VEAL BONELESS TRIMMINGS HALAL” with case code “5398” and “MANFU. DATE” of “04/11/2017.”

60-lb. cases of “VEAL TRIMMINGS USDA CHOICE” with case code “98” and “MANFU. DATE” of “04/11/17.”

10-lb. cases of “VEAL, BEEF, PORK GROUND FOR MEATLOAF BULK PACK” with case code “3125.”
These items were distributed to retail stores and food service locations in Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.

The problem was discovered when the Illinois State Meat Inspection Service notified FSIS on May 2, 2017, about positive non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) samples made with source material produced by Marcho Farms, Inc. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) outbreaks are rare, but tend to primarily be due to contaminated food and person-to-person transmission.Like E. coli O157:H7, non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Consumers and media with questions about the recall can contact Herb Nicolo, Marcho Farms, Inc.’s plant manager, at (215) 721-7131.

PREPARING PRODUCT FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION
USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline
1-888-MPHOTLINE or visitwww.fsis.usda.gov

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.

Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg products and cooked foods.

Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria.

The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

- Fish: 145°F
- Beef, pork, lamb chops/steaks/roasts: 145°F with a three minute rest time
- Ground meat: 160°F

266,2017,5,11,us,"Kabob's Acquisition, Inc. Recalls Meat and Poultry Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, May 10, 2017 – Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc., a Lake City, Ga. establishment, is recalling approximately 5,946 pounds of turkey and ham sandwich products which included a non-meat ingredient that was recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The Monte Cristo (turkey, ham, cheese, on French toast) sandwiches were produced from May 1, 2014 through February 1, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label (PDF Only)]

13.25-lb. bulk cases containing 200 “Kabobs MONTE CRISTO TURKEY BREAST, HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH” in shrink wrapped plastic trays and bearing case codes: PM14E27, PM14H14, PM14J10, PM14E01, PM14E12, PM14E13, PM15C26, PM15E06, PM15G23, PM14L18, PM15A08, PM15C26, PM15K20, PM16B08, PM16B09, PM16F22, PM16F24, and PM17B01.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-6640” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutional locations in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas.

The problem was discovered when Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc., was notified by their French toast ingredient supplier, that the French toast used in the sandwich products was recalled due to potential Lm contamination. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

This additional information was identified during the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) food safety investigation. Pâtisserie Jessica is recalling par Sophie! brand Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Cake from the marketplace due to norovirus. Consumers should not consume the recalled product described below. Recalled products Brand Name Common Name Size Code(s) on Product UPC par Sophie! Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Cake 650 g 17185 8 10175 00926 1 What you should do If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor. Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously. Learn more about the health risks Sign up for recall notifications by email, follow us on Twitter, or join the CFIA community on Facebook View our detailed explanation of the food safety investigation and recall process Background This recall was triggered by findings by the CFIA during its investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak. The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings. The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing recalled product from the marketplace.

The products contain fish (anchovies), a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

326,2018,6,21,us,Now Health Group Inc. Recalls Select Now Real Food® Zesty Sprouting Mix Because of Possible Health Risk,"NOW Health Group, Inc. (NOW), of Bloomingdale, Illinois, is recalling its NOW Real Food® Zesty Sprouting Mix – Product Code 7271, Lot #3031259 and Lot #3038165 – because its primary ingredient, Crimson Clover Seeds, has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.
Approximately 10,000 units of Zesty Sprouting Mix were distributed online and in retail stores nationwide since December 2017.
Recalled products include:
No other products are affected or are involved in this recall. No illnesses have been reported to date.
Evidence of potential contamination was implicated in ongoing FDA and CDC investigations into multistate outbreaks of Salmonella infections, of which the clover seed supplier was notified.
NOW has provided information on this recall to all its retailers who purchased this product and has encouraged retailers to make every effort to contact their customers to facilitate the return of affected products.
Consumers who have purchased the recalled Zesty Sprouting Mix should stop using the product immediately and return it to place of purchase for a full refund. Receipt is not required for refund.
Consumers with questions regarding this recall can contact NOW’s Customer Service Department by phone at 888-NOW-FOODS (888-669-3663) Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Central time.

335,2018,7,25,us,AMPI Recalls Limited Amount of Dry Whey Powder Because of Possible Health Risk,"Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) of New Ulm, Minn., is recalling dry whey powder packaged in 50-pound and 25-kg bags that were produced at the cooperative’s Blair, Wis., dry whey plant from May 1-5, 2018; May 24-29, 2018; June 2-5, 2018; and June 7-14, 2018 due to the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. This is a precautionary recall. All products shipped to the marketplace tested negative for salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The products included in the recall can be identified by the following lot numbers, which can be found printed along the top of the bag. Images of the bags can be found below.
AMPI dry whey powder is not sold directly to consumers, but is used as an ingredient in a number of foods. It is sold directly to manufacturers and also distributed by brokers. A limited amount was sold for animal feed. All products shipped into the marketplace tested negative for salmonella as part of AMPI’s routine testing program. However, because additional product tested positive for salmonella under AMPI’s routine test and hold procedures, the company is recalling product as a precautionary measure. AMPI has ceased production at its Blair, Wis., dry whey plant, is currently investigating the cause for the positive samples, and will take all necessary remedial actions.
All customers that have received the dry whey powder lots have been notified by AMPI and instructed to return the recalled powder, or to document the destruction of the powder, after contacting AMPI for specific instructions.
At AMPI, we are dedicated to producing dairy products that meet the highest quality and safety standards required by our customers as well as complying with all government food safety requirements. We are recalling this product as a precautionary measure and in keeping with our commitment to the best interests of our customers and consumers, and in line with the Food Safety Modernization Act and FDA requirements. We will continue to work cooperatively with the FDA to provide products that meet our customers’ requirements, meet government food safety standards, and provide the nutritious benefits of dairy products to customers throughout the United States.

353,2018,12,4,us,"JBS Tolleson, Inc. Recalls Raw Beef Products due to Possible Salmonella Newport Contamination","EDITOR’S NOTE:


Editor’s note: This release is being reissued as an expansion of the Oct. 4, 2018 recall. The scope of this recall expansion now includes an additional 5,156,076 pounds of raw beef products, which were produced and packed from July 26, 2018 to Sept. 7, 2018. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Editor’s Note: FSIS and our public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health officials, are investigating a Salmonella Newport outbreak. Please note that FSIS is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this widespread outbreak, and additional product from other companies may also be recalled. Salmonella is prevalent and can be present in raw poultry and meat – no raw poultry or meat is sterile. In addition to discarding the product associated with this recall, consumers can protect themselves now and in the future by ALWAYS cooking their raw meat to a safe internal temperature, which is measured by using a food thermometer. The cooking process kills the Salmonella. No one should be eating partially cooked or raw meat. Additionally, it is essential that people wash their hands after handling raw poultry, meat, and pet food to avoid cross contamination.



WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, 2018 – JBS Tolleson, Inc., a Tolleson, Ariz. establishment, is recalling approximately 12,093,271 pounds of non-intact raw beef products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Newport, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The raw, non-intact beef items, including ground beef, were packaged on various dates from July 26, 2018 to Sept. 7, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [Products List (PDF)| Product Labels (PDF only)|
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 267” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a retail locations and institutions nationwide.

After FSIS Recall 085-2018 on October 4, 2018, FSIS, CDC, and state public health and agriculture partners continued to investigate the outbreak of Salmonella Newport illnesses. The epidemiological investigation has identified 246 confirmed case-patients from 26 states with illness onset dates ranging from July 26 to September 7, 2018. An additional 16 case-patients have provided receipts or shopper card numbers for the product traceback investigations. Specific traceback for three case-patients have identified JBS Tolleson, Inc., EST. 267 ground beef products that were not part of the October 4, 2018 recall. FSIS will continue to work with public health partners and provide updated information should it become available. 
Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°F. Other cuts of beef should be cooked to a temperature of 145 °F and allowed to rest for at least 3 minutes. The only way to confirm that ground beef or other cuts of beef are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

FSIS and public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, have been investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Schwarzengrund illnesses involving 5 case patients from 2 states. Wisconsin collected three intact Butterball brand ground turkey samples from a residence where 4 of the case patients live. The case patients and ground turkey Salmonella Schwarzengrund isolates are closely related, genetically.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media with questions regarding the recall can contact Christa Leupen, Manager of Public Relations, at (919) 255-7598. Consumers should call (800) 288-8372.

372,2019,3,23,us,Henry Avocado Recalls Whole Avocados Because Of Possible Health Risk,"Henry Avocado Corporation is voluntarily recalling California-grown whole avocados sold in bulk at retail stores because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Henry Avocado is issuing this voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution due to positive test results on environmental samples taken during a routine government inspection at its California packing facility. There are no reported illnesses associated with this recall.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
The recalled products – California-grown conventional and organic avocados -- were packed at Henry Avocado’s packing facility in California and distributed in Arizona, California, Florida New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin. All shipments from the packing facility are subject to the recall (Henry Avocado did not begin packing there until late January 2019).

375,2019,4,10,us,Great American Marketing Co. Recalls Meat and Poultry Wrap and Salad Products Due to Possible Listeria Monocytogenes Contamination,"WASHINGTON, April 9, 2019 – Great American Marketing, Inc., a Houston, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 3,329 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry wrap and salad products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat wrap and salad meat and poultry products were produced on various dates from March 27, 2019 through April 8, 2019. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels(PDF only)]

9.25-oz. plastic sealed cartons containing “corner store market CAESAR SALAD WITH GRILLED CHICKEN & CAESAR DRESSING” with sell by dates of 04/09/19 through 04/15/19.
	10.25-oz. plastic sealed cartons containing “corner store market CHEF SALAD TURKEY, HAM & CHEESE, WITH RANCH DRESSING” with sell by dates of 04/09/19 through 04/15/19.
	8.1-oz. plastic sealed cartons containing “corner store market CLUB WRAP Turkey, Ham, Roast Beef, Bacon Bits & Cheese” with sell by dates of 04/08/18 through 4/20/19.
	7.4-oz. plastic sealed carton containing “corner store market CHICKEN CAESAR WRAP Chicken Strips & Cheese with Caesar Dressing” with sell by dates of 04/08/18 through 4/20/19.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 31680” or “P-31680” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in Texas.

The problem was discovered when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified FSIS that routine testing of a shared FSIS and FDA processing area within the establishment, was confirmed positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that this product might be in some consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Bill Welch, Vice President of Operations, Great American Marketing, Inc., at (713) 682-6471.

388,2019,6,21,us,Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Voluntary Withdrawal of Unflavored Peñafiel Mineral Spring Water that Does Not Meet FDA Bottled Water Quality Standards,"null BURLINGTON, MA and PLANO, TX - Keurig Dr Pepper today announced it will voluntarily withdraw Peñafiel unflavored mineral spring water products, imported from Mexico, due to the presence of violative levels of arsenic. Arsenic when present in the diet at very high levels, well above those detected in recent samples of Peñafiel, is associated with numerous chronic diseases. Water quality tests of Peñafiel samples conducted by an independent laboratory on behalf of Keurig Dr Pepper detected arsenic at levels that exceeded the FD!’s bottled water standards for mineral water of 10 ppb. All unflavored Peñafiel mineral spring water products including 600mL and 1.5L of all date codes are included in this voluntary withdrawal. The product is packaged in PET bottle formats. Consumers who have this product in their possession can return it to their retailer for a full refund.

Check to see if you have the recalled products in your establishment. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the location where they were purchased. Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die.

Check to see if you have recalled products in your establishment. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the location where they were purchased. Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die. Learn more about the health risks Sign up for recall notifications by email and follow us on social media View our detailed explanation of the food safety investigation and recall process Report a food safety or labelling concern Background This recall was triggered by Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) surveillance activities following an investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak. The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings. The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing recalled product from the marketplace. Illnesses The Public Health Agency of Canada is investigating an outbreak of human illness. Please refer to the Public Health Notice for further details on this active outbreak investigation.

412,2019,11,10,us,Ezzo Sausage Company Recalls Meat Products due to Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9, 2019 – Ezzo Sausage Company, a Columbus, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 25,115 pounds of sausage products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat sausage products were produced on Oct. 29, 2019, Oct. 30, 2019 and Nov. 5, 2019. This spreadsheet contains a list of the products subject to the recall. [View labels(PDF only) 

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 1838A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution centers in Indiana and Ohio.

The problem was discovered when the firm notified FSIS of a positive sample result for Listeria monocytogenes.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in distribution centers, restaurants, or institutional refrigerators or freezers. Restaurants and institutions that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Darryl Thompson, V.P Business Development, Ezzo Sausage Company, at (614) 445-8841.

Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.

Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die.

Products that contained frozen diced eggs from Almark Foods have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. This recall is taking place due to supplier notification that Almark Foods supplied certain lots of frozen diced egg products which may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes and its association with a Listeria monocytogenes foodborne illness outbreak investigation. Products were distributed through wholesale distributors to restaurants, delis, cafeterias, and foodservice establishments in the following states: Tennessee, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Arkansas. The affected products were packaged in either plastic or aluminum trays.

Ltd. Distribution: Alberta, British Columbia Extent of the distribution: Retail Contents Recall details What you should do Background Illnesses Public enquiries and media Recall details Ottawa, February 22, 2020 - Sawmill Bay Shellfish Co. Ltd. is recalling certain Sawmill Bay Shellfish brand Pacific Aquacultured Oysters from the marketplace due to norovirus. Consumers should not consume and distributors, retailers and food service establishments such as hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and nursing homes should not sell or use the recalled product described below. Recalled product Brand Product Size UPC Codes Additional Information Sawmill Bay Shellfish Pacific Aquacultured Oysters By the dozen None Lots: 453 and 454 Sold only to hotels, restaurants and institutions None Pacific Aquacultured Oysters Variable count None None – All units sold from February 12 to 19, 2020, inclusive Sold at Codfather's Seafood Market, Kelowna BC What you should do If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor. Check to see if you have the recalled product in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

Our advice to consumers If you have bought any of the above products do not eat them. Instead, return them to the store from where they were bought for a full refund. About product recalls and withdrawals If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). The FSA issues Product Withdrawal Information Notices and Product Recall Information Notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems associated with food. In some cases, a 'Food Alert for Action' is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers.

447,2020,5,13,us,Ideal Foods Recalls Meat and Poultry Flatbread Pizza Products Produced Without Benefit of Inspection,"WASHINGTON, May 12, 2020 – Ideal Foods, a North Las Vegas, Nev. establishment, is recalling approximately 3,302 pounds of meat and poultry flatbread pizza products that were produced, packed and distributed without the benefit of federal inspection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The flatbread pizza products made with meat and poultry items were produced on various dates from October 2019 to April 2020. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels(PDF Only)]  

13.5-oz. plastic-wrapped cardboard trays containing “culinevo Artisan Style Flatbread Pizza CARNE ASADA”.
	13-oz. plastic-wrapped cardboard trays containing “culinevo Artisan Style Flatbread Pizza CHICKEN SPINACH ARTICHOKE”.
	16.5-oz. plastic-wrapped cardboard trays containing “culinevo Artisan Style Flatbread Pizza SIZZLIN JALAPEÑO”.
	14.5-oz. plastic-wrapped cardboard trays containing “culinevo Artisan Style Flatbread Pizza MEAT LOVERS”.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 45351A” or “P-45351A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a distributor and retail locations in California.

The problem was discovered during routine FSIS surveillance activities, which determined that the firm produced the products without the benefit of inspection.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Consumers and members of the media with questions about the recall can contact John Hagen, Chief Financial Operations Officer, Ideal Foods, at (702) 647-3663.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

The product was distributed to grocery stores between 4/17/2020 and 4/21/2020. They were then physically removed from the stores on 5/14/2020. The product is labeled “Radhuni Curry Powder”. The product is contained in 400g clear, plastic bottles, with an expiration date of 01/02/2022, which can be found printed on the side of the container. No illnesses have been reported to date.

The products being recalled are Dole™ Organic Romaine Hearts 3pk (UPC 0-71430-90061-1), combined English/French packaging, with Harvested-On dates of 10-23-20 and 10-26-20, and Wild Harvest Organic Romaine Hearts (UPC 7-11535-50201-2), with Harvested-On dates of 10-23-20 and 10-26-20.  The recall is being conducted due to a possible health risk from E. coli in the two products.  Dole Fresh Vegetables is coordinating closely with regulatory officials. No illnesses have been reported to date in association with the recall.  Pathogenic E. coli can cause diarrhea, severe stomach cramps and vomiting.  Most people recover within a week, but some illnesses can last longer and can be more severe. The Harvested-On sticker is located on the upper right corner of each bag and the UPC code is located on the bottom right corner of the back of each bag. The Dole package contains three organic romaine hearts and the Wild Harvest product is packaged in a 12oz bag. The impacted products were distributed in AZ, HI, IA, IL, IN, KS, MD, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND and VA. These products were harvested and packed nearly 4 weeks ago and should no longer be in commerce.  Consumers are advised to check product they have in their homes and discard any product matching the production description, UPC codes and Harvested-On dates listed above. This precautionary recall notification is being issued due to an isolated instance in which a package of Dole™ Organic Romaine Hearts – 3pk yielded a positive result for pathogenic non-O157 E.coli STEC in a routine sample collected at a retail store by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. There is no indication at this time that this positive result is related to any illnesses nor consumer complaints and it is not associated with the strains connected to the ongoing outbreaks currently under regulatory investigation.  No other Dole products are included in the recall. This voluntary recall does not apply to any bagged or clamshell salad romaine product. Only the specific Organic Romaine Hearts listed, with the exact UPC codes and Harvested-On dates identified above, are included in the recall. Consumers who have any remaining product with these UPC codes and Harvested-On dates should not consume it, but rather discard it.

479,2020,12,23,us,B&G Foods Issues Voluntary Allergy Alert on Undeclared Soy in a Limited Number of Containers of Food Club Garlic Powder That Incorrectly Contain Bacon-Flavored Bits,"B&G Foods announced today it is voluntarily recalling individual containers of 5.37 oz. Food Club Garlic Powder, with “best by” dates of NOV 19 22 and NOV 20 22, because they mistakenly contain bacon-flavored bits, which contain soy, an allergen undeclared on the garlic powder labels. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to soy run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the bacon-flavored bits contained in the recalled containers. There is no health risk associated with this product for individuals without an allergy to soy. This recall affects only the following product, which may have been distributed in retail stores nationwide: This recall does not apply to any other “best by” dates, sizes or varieties of Food Club brand products. No allergic reactions or consumer complaints related to this matter have been reported to date. It was determined that 1,301 cases of bacon-flavored bits, which contain soy, an allergen undeclared on garlic powder labels, may contain some individual containers inadvertently labeled as garlic powder. Containers labeled as Food Club Bacon Flavored Bits correctly indicate that the containers include bacon-flavored bits and correctly declare the presence of soy. This recall was initiated in cooperation with the FDA. The recalled product has clear packaging and therefore it should be readily apparent to consumers that any mislabeled containers contain bacon-flavored bits instead of garlic powder. However, out of an abundance of caution, B&G Foods is issuing this recall for containers of Food Club Garlic Powder with the particular “best by” dates listed above. Consumers who have purchased the recalled product can return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Recalls All Performance Dog and Ground Beef Raw Pet Food Because of Possible Salmonella and Listeria Monocytogenes Health Risk to Humans and Animals","Bravo Packing, Inc. of Carneys Point, NJ is recalling all Ground Beef and Performance Dog, a frozen raw pet food because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Salmonella can cause illness in animals eating the products, as well as people who handle contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products, infected animals or any surfaces exposed to these products.  Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, server headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Healthy people infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis (an infection of the heart muscle), arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms. People who have these symptoms after having contact with this product or an animal that has eaten this product should contact their healthcare providers. Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have decreased appetite, fever and abdominal pain. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian. Infected animals including those without symptoms, can also shed Salmonella through their feces and saliva, spreading pathogens into the home environment and to humans and other animals in the household. No human or animal illnesses have been reported to date. Bravo Packing, Inc. is voluntarily recalling the products after samples of Performance Dog and a sample of Ground Beef were collected during an FDA inspection, tested positive for Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Performance Dog generally works with the distributor located in Brooklyn, New York, that fills orders to brick-and-mortar retail stores or to consumers directly nationwide. Performance Dog and Ground Beef both come frozen in 2-pound and 5-pound plastic sleeves. If you have an Ground Beef or Performance Dog, please throw it away.

Members of the public should not consume the affected batch of the product. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.       Product details are as follows:   Product name: HONGKONG SHRIMP FLAVOR NOODLE Brand: GOURMET ALLEY Place of origin: Hong Kong Net weight: 454 grams per pack Best-before date: June 11, 2023   ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample of shrimp noodles from an online shop for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide at a level of 52 parts per million (ppm), exceeding the legal limit of 20 ppm. The functional class and name of the additive were also not declared on the food label,"" a CFS spokesman said.        ""The CFS has informed the vendor concerned and the manufacturer which produced the shrimp noodles of the irregularities, and instructed the vendor concerned to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batch of the product. The vendor concerned has initiated a recall according to the CFS' instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2606 8658 during office hours for enquiries about the recall. The CFS is also tracing the source of the affected product,"" the spokesman added.       Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headache and nausea after consumption.       The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD). Furthermore, the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more, the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.       The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, Aug. 27, 2021 – Fratelli Beretta USA, Inc., a Mount Olive, N.J. establishment, is recalling approximately 862,000 pounds of uncured antipasto products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Infantis and/or Salmonella Typhimurium, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat (RTE) uncured antipasto meat trays were produced on February 28, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The following products are subject to recall [view labels]: 

24-oz. trays containing two 12-oz packages of “Fratelli Beretta UNCURED ANTIPASTO PROSCIUTTO, SOPPRESSATA, MILANO SALAMI & COPPA” with best by dates of AUG 27 21 through FEB 11 22 and UPC code 073541305316.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 7543B” printed on the packaging next to the best by date. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.             

FSIS has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health partners to investigate a multistate outbreak of 36 Salmonella Typhimurium and Infantis illnesses in 17 states, with onset dates ranging from May 9 through July 27, 2021. Some ill people reported eating Fratelli Beretta brand uncured antipasto before they got sick and the traceback investigation confirmed that some of the ill people purchased uncured antipasto trays produced by Fratelli Beretta USA, Inc. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state and local public health partners on this investigation to determine if additional products are linked to illness. FSIS will provide updated information if it becomes available.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 6 hours to 6 days after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product is in consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Fratelli Beretta USA Inc.’s recall hotline at 1-866-918-8738. Media may contact Marco Lastrico of Barabino & Partners USA, at m.lastrico@barabinousa.com or 917-634-1685.

Members of the public should not consume the affected batches of products. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of products immediately if they possess them. Product details are as follows: Product name: Chinese Date Brand: Green dot dot Place of origin: China Net weight: 350 grams Distributor: Organic Gardens International Limited (recall hotline: 3181 4488) Best-before date: July 23, 2022 Product name: Tianjin Preserved Vegetable Brand: (not available in English) Place of origin: China Net weight: 300 grams Distributor: Golden Long Food Trading Limited (recall hotline: 2566 3007) Best-before date: December 31, 2022 Product name: (not available in English) Brand: Kai's Gourmet Place of origin: China Net weight: 38 grams Importer: Kairun Food HK Ltd.

The test results showed that the samples contained sulphur dioxide. Although the sulphur dioxide levels are below the maximum permitted level under the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD), the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food labels of the samples,"" a CFS spokesman said. ""The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities, and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batches of products. The above-mentioned distributors/ importer have initiated a recall according to the CFS' instructions. Members of the public may call the respective hotlines above during office hours for enquiries about the recall,"" the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headache and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD). Furthermore, the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more, the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

Dole Fresh Vegetables, Inc.,is voluntarily recalling from the market all Dole-branded and private label packaged salads processed at its Bessemer City, NC and its Yuma, AZ production facilities due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes and is also temporarily suspending operations at both facilities to conduct an extensive cleaning and sanitation protocol. Products subject to the voluntary recall are identified by a product lot code beginning with the either the letter “N” or “Y” in the upper right-hand corner of the package (see examples below) and will have a “Best if Used By” date between November 30, 2021, and January 8, 2022. Consumers who still have any of these products in their refrigerators are urged not to consume the product and to discard it immediately. This suspension of operations and recall are being performed voluntarily by Dole out of an abundance of caution, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The decision to suspend operations and recall all products from these facilities was made after analyzing the strain of Listeria monocytogenes isolated in a single package of Dole-branded Garden Salad produced in the Bessemer City facility and a single package of shredded iceberg lettuce produced in the Yuma, AZ facility. Both of those items were randomly sampled by the state of Georgia and the state of Michigan, respectively, and were a genetic match with a strain of Listeria monocytogenes which FDA and CDC believe is responsible for sixteen illnesses since 2014. Listing of products subject to each of these recalls is set forth below. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Recalled salad items from the Bessemer City facility were distributed in the states of AL, CT, FL, GA, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS, NC, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, and VA.

In addition, no other Dole products, including “ready-to-eat” salad products, fresh fruit, and field-packed fresh vegetables, are part of these voluntary recalls and are safe to consume. Dole retailers have been advised to check store shelves and warehouse inventories to confirm that no recalled product is available for purchase by consumers.

539,2022,2,17,us,Abbott Voluntarily Recalls Powder Formulas Manufactured at One Plant,"Abbott (NYSE: ABT) is initiating a proactive, voluntary recall of powder formulas, including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare manufactured in Sturgis, Mich., one of the company's manufacturing facilities. The recall does not include any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas. Abbott is voluntarily recalling these products after four consumer complaints related to Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella Newport in infants who had consumed powder infant formula manufactured in this facility. Additionally, as part of Abbott's quality processes, we conduct routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and other pathogens in our manufacturing facilities. During testing in our Sturgis, Mich., facility, we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in non-product contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport. This investigation is ongoing. Importantly, no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of either of these bacteria, and we continue to test. Abbott conducts extensive quality checks on each completed batch of infant formula, including microbiological analysis prior to release. All finished products are tested for Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella Newport and other pathogens and they must test negative before any product is released. Additionally, retained samples related to the three complaints for Cronobacter sakazakii tested negative for Cronobacter sakazakii. And the retained sample related to the complaint for Salmonella Newport tested negative for Salmonella Newport. While Abbott's testing of finished product detected no pathogens, we are taking action by recalling the powder formula manufactured in this facility with an expiration of April 1, 2022, or later. No Abbott liquid formulas, powder formulas, or nutrition products from other facilities are impacted by the recall. Cronobacter sakazakii is commonly found in the environment and a variety of areas in the home. It can cause fever, poor feeding, excessive crying or low energy as well as other serious symptoms. It's important to follow the instructions for proper preparation, handling and storage of powder formulas. ""We know parents depend on us to provide them with the highest quality nutrition formulas,"" said Joe Manning, executive vice president, nutritional products, Abbott. ""We're taking this action so parents know they can trust us to meet our high standards, as well as theirs. We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this situation will cause parents, caregivers and health care professionals."" What Parents and Caregivers Should Do The products under recall have a multidigit number on the bottom of the container starting with the first two digits 22 through 37, contains K8, SH, or Z2 and with an expiration date of April 1, 2022, or after. To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, visit similacrecall.com and type in the code on the bottom of the package, or call +1-800-986-8540 (U.S.) and follow the instructions provided. No action is needed for previously consumed product. If you have questions about feeding your child, contact your healthcare professional. Some product was distributed to countries outside the U.S. A list of these products can be found at similacrecall.com.

Although the exact strain has yet to be determined customers must not eat this product as it may pose a serious health risk. Pathogenic Escherichia coli can cause diarrhea, severe stomach cramps and vomiting. Most people recover within a week, but some illnesses can last longer and can be more severe. The recalled product was distributed nationwide to 1,049 potential customers through mail orders, and would have been received by customers after June 6, 2022. The product comes in a 40 gram package marked with lot # D22151011 on the outside of the wrapper. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this recall. The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing conducted by an accredited third-party laboratory at the request of Built Brands detected the presence of Escherichia coli. Testing results for additional products made by Built Brands indicate other similar products are not affected and the contamination was an isolated incident, likely resulting from a failure to follow GMP practices.
